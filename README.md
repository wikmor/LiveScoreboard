My Assumptions:
- Decreasing the match score is permissible, for example, if a goal is initially deemed valid but is later confirmed not to be a goal after VAR verification.
- Similar to removing an item from a list in Java, we don't throw an exception when finishing a match that doesn't exist.

TODO:
- Check for NPE?
- Custom exceptions
